<h3>Core correction part of the full stress tensor in the APW based method</h3>

    The core_corr_stress.f95 file calculates the core part of the stress 
    tensor implemented in the WIEN2k package. This code basically calculates 
    Eq.(G6) of our paper "Kamal Belbase, Andreas Tr√∂ster, and Peter Blaha 
    Phys. Rev. B 104, 174113" or Eq.(6.48) of Core_Correction_stress.pdf (
    in this repo). In order to use this code, the spherical part 
    of the charge density and structure parameters must be supplied. These 
    parameters are readily available as a by-product of the total energy 
    calculations. The non-spherical part of the potential is read 
    by itself. The assumption is that the core density is still spherical, 
    but the potential after the system is deformed will have a non-spherical part.
     
<p>As the implementation progresses, first the non-spherical part of the potential (DataFiles/Non-spherical_potential.vns) at each radial point (ri) for the combined index (lm1p) of l and m and for each atom (jatom) is read and stored in the variable <b>vns_st(ri,lm1p), jatom)</b>. This action is performed in subroutine <b>'read_vns()'</b> (find at the end of <b>core_corr_stress.f95</b>), and called from the outside a loop that runs over different kinds of atoms in the system and accesses all stored variables through the module. </p>

The multfc_core subroutine calculates the necessary factor when converting complex spherical harmonics to real ones - factor before the square bracket on the right side in the equation. The important thing about working with real spherical harmonics is that it is easy on memory and they are the most appropriate basis functions for calculations where atomic symmetry is important.(https://docs.abinit.org/theory/spherical_harmonics/)<br>

<h3>Electrostatic part of the full stress tensor in the APW based method</h3>
 ELECTROSTATIC_STRESS.F95 <br>
 
    This computes the change in the electrostatic energy, Coulomb and Madelung 
    energy, when a dofrmation is applied in a given system. The code first compute 
    the change in local coordinate system and later it is transormed to the global 
    coordinate system using similarity transformation. The expression is given in 
    Eq (G5) (the second line) in our publication.
